# Resume

## Getting Started

### Get the resume
Make a directory for your project.  Clone or download and extract the seed in that directory.
```
git clone git@github.com:alaviamir/resume.git
```

### Install tools
If you don't have it already, you'll need bower to be installed globally on your machine.  

Install [bower](https://bower.io/) globally `npm install bower -g`  

### Install the dependencies
Change directory into the new project you just cloned, then install dependencies.
`bower install`
